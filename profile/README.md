# Neux Foundation – Open Source Software

We build and maintain open-source systems designed for clarity, efficiency, and trust.  
Our mission is to create tools that empower developers and communities without barriers or hidden costs.

## Philosophy

- **Freedom** – Software should serve its users, not control them.  
- **Transparency** – Code must be visible, understandable, and auditable.  
- **Sustainability** – Technology should endure beyond trends or corporations.  
- **Precision** – Every line of code must have a reason to exist.

## Focus Areas

- Developer tools and automation frameworks  
- Secure infrastructure and open protocols  
- Lightweight systems for education and research  
- Cross-platform interoperability

## Governance

Neux Foundation operates as a neutral, non-commercial entity.  
All projects under **nxf-oss** are released under permissive open-source licenses and maintained with public accountability.
